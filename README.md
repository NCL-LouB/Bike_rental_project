# Bike_rental_project
A bike rental company has been collecting data on how many bikes they have rented out to customers each day for a period of 2 years. In addition to the number of bikes rented, they have also captured the weather conditions of each day. The company would like help to understand how the change in weather effects the number of bikes the company rent out each day. Please see the attached dataset labelled ‘bike rental data’.   Please provide a report with a maximum of 500 words and 2 figures, on how you have deciphered the data and provided the company with appropriate insight to their problem.
